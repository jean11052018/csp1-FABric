        <p class="card-text card-text1 text-justify">Fabric is processed by knitting or weaving, thus creating a cloth. This fabric is made into textile products. Knitting and weaving are two very interesting achievements of human race. 
<!--         <br>
        As far as historians can tell the first use of woven textiles, rather than just animal hides, dates back roughly 100,000 years. Discovered in a Neolithic site in Anatolia, these surviving examples of textiles are believed to date from 6500 BC. Made from a very basic form of felt; it would have been produced on a loom and then tied in place -->.</p>

        <h3 class="card-text card-text-header text-center">History of Sewing</h3>
        <p class="card-text card-text1 text-justify">When people first started to wear clothing, they didn't sew it at all. They just wrapped leather or furs around themselves.
        <br>
<!--         But people living in Central Asia, where it was colder    began using sharp pointed sticks or stone tools called awls to poke holes in their clothes so they can run the cords through the clothes instead of just around them to make their clothing warmer and stronger.
        <br>
        Still in Central Asia, somebody had the idea to make a hole in the end of the awl and thread the first needle. This made sewing a lot faster and easier, and soon spread to other cold places like Northern Europe and North America. The early needles were made out of bone and ivory, like awls. --></p>

        <h3 class="card-text card-text-header text-center">Future of Fabric</h3>
        <p class="card-text card-text3 text-justify">We've come a long way from the time we started using fabric for clothing. In the beginning we only use natural fabrics, from the fibres of flax, silk, cotton, and wool. 
        <br>
<!--         And we also learned how to put printing onto fabric that dates back as far as fourth century, in China.  It was also in China that they started dyeing textiles, around 5000 years ago. Back then, they used natural dyes from insects and plants to produce vivid colors on silk and linens. It was around the 19th century that we started using synthetic dyes
        <br>
        We also developed a way to use synthetic fibres to solve problems we have with natural fabrics that lacks elasticity and wrinkles easily.
        <br>
        What's next? We are now looking into fabrics with all sorts of technological enhancements. We now have what we call Smart Textiles, these are fabrics that have been developed that provide added value to the wearer. It has the ability to do many things that traditional fabric cannot, includin communicate, transform, conduct energy and even grow. --></p>
